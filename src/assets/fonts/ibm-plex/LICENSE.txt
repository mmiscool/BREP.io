Upstream-Name: IBM Plex
Source: https://github.com/IBM/plex
Disclaimer:
 IBM releases Plex as "open source", but unfortunately the freedom status of
 the font is less than ideal, as it requires non-free software to be built
 from source (see README.md, Requirements section, and [0]). The problematic
 step is the hinting, which is done with FontLab Studio, which is proprietary
 software. There is currently no Free Software program that is able to work
 with the high-level hinting command language used by FontLab Studio.
 .
 Moreover, the license Plex is released with includes a "Reserved Font Name"
 clause for the "Plex" name, stating that:
 .
  No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
  Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
  Copyright Holder.
 .
 According to the Open Font License FAQ ([1], Question 5.9), a rebuilt font is
 considered a "Modified Version", and requires a name change to be distributed.
 .
 For these two reasons Plex is not distributed in "main" section of the Debian
 archive, but in the "contrib" section.

 The short-lived upstream version v1.1.4 was dual-licensed as "OFL-1.1
 or Apache-2.0". The Apache license has been pulled from v1.1.5 because
 of a request of the IBM legal team. There is an upstream issue where these
 licensing changes are discussed: https://github.com/IBM/plex/issues/190.

 PREAMBLE
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
 open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
 with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
 to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .
